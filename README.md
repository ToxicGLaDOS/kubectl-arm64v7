# What is this
This is a Dockefile that builds a container with `kubectl` in it. This is intended to be built for arm64v7, but probably will work on other architectures. That's basically it!

You can pull the image from dockerhub at `toxicglados/kubectl`.

Try it out with `docker run -it --rm toxicglados/kubectl`.
